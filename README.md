#Code from various small projects using an Atmel ATiny2313 microprocessor#

This code is missing the layout of the (bread)board used for implementing the
circuit. I hope it may still be useful. Here is a short description of what can
be found in the different folders:

* 7seg: controlling a seven segment display
* blinkLED: blinking a LED
* servo: code for controlling a servo motor
* servoManuell: same but including a push button
* tasterLED: lighting a LED when button is pushed
